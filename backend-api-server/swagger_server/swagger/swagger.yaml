            \ payment, do not deliver any goods (fraudulent_online_shops i.e. fake\

            \ actual accommodations and airlines despite prepayments. Transferred\

            \ by participating in studies. For this purpose, ID documents should be\
            \ shared when registering. Criminals use this to open an account with\
            \ banks and pretend to their victims that a video identification process\
            \ of a bank should be tested as part of the first survey. This gives criminals\

            website is any website that directly sells a product or service. Not to
            be confused with a business website, with an ecommerce website you can
            add products or services into your cart, and pay for them through the
            site media_or_entertainment - Media websites contain regularly updated
            content on current affairs, weather, sports and entertainment. News sites
            like CNN and entertainment sites like ELLE both fall into this category.
            The content on media sites is dynamic, meaning it’s updated regularly.
            Big media sites will publish multiple articles and videos every single
            day. blog - A blog is a website that’s regularly updated, run by one person
            or a small group, and is normally written in a laid-back style business
            - A business website is any kind of website that describes your business.
            crowdfunding - Crowdfunding websites work by taking ‘pledges’ of different
            amounts from lots of people, in order to hit the target amount needed
            to produce the product educational - The term ‘educational’ covers a broad
            range of websites.Educational websites use any combination of games, articles,
            videos and images to educate their audience. These might be geared towards
            fun learning for children, or offer courses to adults, such as Coursera
            and EdX. nonprofit - Nonprofits may not be classed as businesses in the
            same way, but they still need a website. These will generally be quite
            simple, outlining what the nonprofit is about and showing visitors how
            they can get involved, donate, or support in some other way. personal
            - Website that''s dedicated to your ‘personal brand’ not a business website.
            portfolio - If you’re a writer, artist or designer, you’ll want to go
            one step further than a personal website. These are a way for creatives
            to showcase their work to future employees, market themselves as freelancers,
            and generally get their name (and work) out into the big wide world. portal
            - Portal websites, like Yahoo, bring together information from lots of
            different sites and present them in one place. Web portals can be internal
            websites for organizations like schools, or for big businesses. It’s a
            centralized place to share news, training and updates, and for students
            or employees to access their emails and files. Users will need their own
            specific login to access these portals. social_media - A special form
